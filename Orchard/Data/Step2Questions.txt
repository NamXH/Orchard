Click the button under the picture that most closely resembles the average tree shape in your block. Each shape has an associated volume required to acheive coverage. The greatest volume is the cube shape (1.0x) and the smallest is the spherical shape (0.5x). If you are unsure which shape best matches your orchard, go with the  larger volume.
As canopies fill, more volume is needed. Enter growth stage.
Compare your trees to the pictures below. Pictures on the left are Pre Petal Fall, and the pictures on the right are Post Petal Fall. Select the density that best matches the density (not shape) of the trees in your block. Your trees may match a picture or fall in between. A description of each density will appear in the grey field. Be aware that trees do not always have to be young or small to be considered "open".
